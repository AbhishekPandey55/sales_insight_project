# Sales Data Analysis & Customer Segmentation

A simple but powerful data analysis project. I clean sales data, find key insights, and use machine learning to segment customers into groups. Very useful for business decisions.

## What I Did

-   **Cleaned and Prepared** the sales data for analysis.
-   **Found Insights** like top products and most profitable regions.
-   **Used Machine Learning** (K-Means Clustering) to group customers into 3 types.
-   **Created Visualizations** to easily understand the results.

## Tools I Used

-   **Python** with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
-   **Data Cleaning** and **Exploration**
-   **Machine Learning** with Scikit-learn

## How to Run

1.  Install libraries: `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn`
2.  Run the code: `python sales_analysis.py`
